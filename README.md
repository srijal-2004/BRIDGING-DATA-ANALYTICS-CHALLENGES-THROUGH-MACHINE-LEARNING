# BRIDGING-DATA-ANALYTICS-CHALLENGES-THROUGH-MACHINE-LEARNING
This work evaluates maintenance challenges in electric aircraft and assesses preventive maintenance strategies to enhance safety and aircraft availability. It also highlights the importance of maintenance by implementing three ML models—XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree—for predictive maintenance of machine and engine tools.
