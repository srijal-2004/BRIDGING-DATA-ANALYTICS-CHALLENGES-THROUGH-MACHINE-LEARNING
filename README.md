# BRIDGING DATA ANALYTICS CHALLENGES THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING : A STUDY ON BUSINESS INSIGHTS AND PREDICTIVE APPLICATIONS

Because electric aircraft rely on batteries and other electrical components to function, having
an effective maintenance strategy can be critical to minimizing the risk of unexpected failures
and operational interruptions. This work aims to evaluate challenges limiting maintenance for
electric aircraft as well as evaluation of preventive maintenance strategy of electric aircraft
components to increase safety and aircraft availability. Another main purpose is to understand
the importance of maintenance and to implement three Machine Learning (ML) models viz.,
XGBoost Classifier, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, for predictive maintenance of the
machine/engine tools. We will then find out the most accurate Machine Learning model by
comparing and analysing the results of all the ML models
